# Raspberry Pi Standard Install for Development or Projects

* **Pi Version:** Raspberry Pi 3 B+
* **PiOS Version:** 
* **Date:** 

**A Note:** These are my notes to help me streamline the process of readying a Raspi for development or project work. Your use and therefore your process may vary. My engagement with the Pi is episodic and these notes may fall out of date as new technology and new tools may emerge.

## Use Case

I frequently use Raspberry Pis to serve as a behind-the-scenes controller for projects. In the last several years, the Pi has controller for:

* A retro gaming system
* A "chicken robot" to open and close the doors of our chicken coop, and serve IR camera images so we could confirm the door was closed and everyone accounted for
* An audio and visual piece at Burning Man
* Controller for a musical instrument and LED controller for another piece at Burning Man
* A smart video sequencer/player for art exhibitions
* A primary controller and video/audio player with various arduino secondaries to control peripherals in an art installation
* A "time machine" radio that allowed you to tune in to various radio stations that represented different eras and styles

In all these cases, the Pi was the obvious choice because of its incredible adaptibility and modularity, including:

* standard Unix OS/Debian
* ability to run python and its many useful modules
* Chromium browser with leading edge JavaScript support
* GPIO access to control hardware
* selection of various inexpensive hats/peripheral boards
